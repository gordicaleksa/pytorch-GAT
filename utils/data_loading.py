"""
    Currently I only have support for Cora dataset - feel free to add your own graph data.
    You can find the details on how Cora was constructed here: http://eliassi.org/papers/ai-mag-tr08.pdf

    TL;DR:
    The feature vectors are 1433 features long. The authors found the most frequent words across every paper
    in the graph (they've removed the low frequency words + some additional processing) and made a vocab from those.
    Now feature "i" in the feature vector tells us whether the paper contains i-th word from the vocab (1-yes, 0-no).
    e.g. : feature vector 100...00 means that this node/paper contains only the 0th word of the vocab.


    Note on Cora processing:
        GAT and many other papers (GCN, etc.) used the processed version of Cora that can be found here:
        https://github.com/kimiyoung/planetoid

        I started from that same data, and after pre-processing it the same way as GAT and GCN,
        I've saved it into only 3 files so there is no need to copy-paste the same pre-processing code around anymore.

        Node features are saved in CSR sparse format, labels go from 0-6 (not one-hot) and finally the topology of the
        graph remained the same I just renamed it to adjacency_list.dict.


    Note on sparse matrices:
        If you're like me you didn't have to deal with sparse matrices until you started playing with GNNs.
        You'll usually see the following formats in GNN implementations: LIL, COO, CSR and CSC.
        Occasionally, you'll also see DOK and in special settings DIA and BSR as well (so 7 in total).

        It's not nuclear physics (it's harder :P) check out these 2 links and you're good to go:
            * https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html
            * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix

        TL;DR:
        LIL, COO and DOK are used for efficient modification of your sparse structure/graph topology (add/remove edges)
        CSC and CSR are used for efficient arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
        DIA and BSR are used when you're dealing with special types of sparse matrices - diagonal and block matrices.
